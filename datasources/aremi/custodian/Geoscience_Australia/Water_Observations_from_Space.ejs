The Landsat data underpinning WOfS is ARG25 standard data located in the Australian Geoscience Data Cube (AGDC) at the National Computational Infrastructure (NCI) in the Australian National University (ANU), Canberra. The WOfS product is calculated from all acceptable Landsat scenes in the Geoscience Australia archive for the time period. The detection process is based on spectral analysis of each pixel in each Landsat scene.\n\nThe water detection algorithm used to detect water from each observed pixel is based on a statistical regression tree analysis of a set of normalised difference indices and corrected band values. The regression is based on a set of water and non-water samples created by visual interpretation of 20 Landsat scenes from across Australia. The sample locations, ensure that the logistic regression is based on the full geographic range of conditions experienced in Australia.\n\nThe regression analysis determined a set of best indices and bands for the analysis and the associated thresholds in each component to derive a final classification tree, producing a water/non-water classification for every pixel in the Data Cube. The final water classification for each pixel is modified by Pixel Quality (see associated RG25 - PQ product information) and terrain.\n\nOnce the water algorithm has completed its process, the water detection for a pixel through time is combined to produce a total number of water observations for each pixel. This is compared to a total number of clear observations for the same pixel, derived from the PQ analysis. The ratio is expressed as a percentage water recurrence.\n\nA separate analysis produces a confidence dataset, providing an assessment on whether a pixel depicted as having had water detected at some time is likely.
