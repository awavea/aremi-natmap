The Solar Station Historical Observation (SSHO) data layer is a derivative created by AREMI and based on the Bureau of Meteorology One Minute Solar data (described in detail under Source Data below). The One Minute Solar data was processed using the aremi-tmy tool, due to be Open Sourced soon at the following URL:

The aremi-tmy tool will be used to generate Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) data. As part of the processing an intermediate output is the SSHO data. The SSHO was generated by placing the Bureau One Minute Solar data values into hourly buckets, and calculating the arithmetic mean per hour. Any data gaps of less than 5 hours were linearly interpolated (by individual field, e.g. temperature). Gaps larger than this were ignored and are therefore still present in the SSHO. As a result of this processing, this is a more complete dataset compared to the One Minute Solar data, but with less resolution. A future goal is to have any gaps less than 24 hours filled.
<p>
The SSHO data available here was processed using aremi-tmy version 0.1.0.0 from the source Bureau One Minute Solar data. Start dates for the Bureau's One Minute Solar data and the period over which stations have made solar observations vary significantly. The first sites began recording solar data in 1993, while the most recently opened sites commenced in 2012. Some stations are now closed. The number of years of data recorded can be accessed by clicking on the station to display the site data.
